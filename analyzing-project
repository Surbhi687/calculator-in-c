<br>

the README.md contains information about the project, description or usage directions. 
It contains rationale (why this project was created), features and known issues, how to use the calculator, and building (steps) of the calculator.

<br>
the calculator.c file contains the implementations of the functions declared in `calculator.h`.
calulator.c includes following functions: 
<br>
//function to add number
double add(double a, double b) {
    return a + b;
}

//function to subtract the second number from the first
double subtract(double a, double b) {
    return a - b;
}

//function to multiply two numbers
double multiply(double a, double b) {
    return a * b;
}

//function to divide the first number by the second
double divide(double a, double b) {
    if (b != 0) {
        return a / b;
    } else {
        fprintf(stderr, "Error: Division by zero\n");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }
}

//function to raise the base to the power of the exponent
double power(double base, double exponent) {
    return pow(base, exponent);
}

//function to calculate the square root of a number
double sqrt_custom(double a) {
    if (a >= 0) {
        return sqrt(a);
    } else {
        fprintf(stderr, "Error: Negative input for square root\n");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }
}
